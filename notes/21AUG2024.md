# netcat / server examples
* code on isoptera
* sockstream TCP
* datagram UDP

* socket
* bind
* listen
* accept

* check manual page for recv() and `MSG_DONTWAIT`, `MSG_PEEK`
  * use `MSG_PEEK` to view data in stream without removing it
  * server perf point: 
    * network will be the weak link in performance, not the syscalls (typically)
    * using `MSG_PEEK` will invoke at least two syscalls -- one to peek, one to handle the data
  * `MSG_WAITALL`
    * useful for waiting on a stream of a specific size

* be careful with streams -- data won't necessarily arrive in the correct order
  * TCP will handle error checking & re-assemble the stream in order

* htons()
  * convert network byte order to server byte order (network byte order is little endian)
