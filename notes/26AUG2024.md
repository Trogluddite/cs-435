# multi-threaded servers
* note that netcat listens once and then closes
* can adjust this to start a new socket each time
* consider denial of service -- one connection, never send anything, will wait forever
* ttls are a common way to deal with this
* we can also multi-thread

# looking at code
* we have a main thread
* client thread(s) -- one of many
* we're using pthreads & C
  * C++ 2011 threads will work fine too

passing args to pthreads: 
* we created a struct for args
* we malloc sizeof struct
* then set the values
